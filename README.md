# Coffee Consumption & Cardiovascular Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This capstone project explores the relationship between coffee (caffeine) consumption and cardiovascular health indicators using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.

The analysis focuses on understanding how caffeine intake relates to heart rate, BMI, sleep quality, stress levels, and overall cardiovascular risk. The project was designed to support evidence-based clinical insights and patient counseling using data analytics.

This project was completed as part of a Data Analytics Capstone and received top evaluation for clarity, insights, and presentation.

## Business Problem
Healthcare providers frequently receive patient concerns regarding coffee consumption and heart health. However, misconceptions around caffeine often lead to unnecessary anxiety or oversimplified recommendations.

This project aims to:
- Identify whether caffeine intake significantly impacts cardiovascular indicators
- Highlight patient subgroups that may benefit from caffeine reduction
- Demonstrate how analytics can support preventive healthcare decisions

---

## Key Questions
1. To what extent does coffee (caffeine) consumption relate to cardiovascular-related indicators such as heart rate, BMI, sleep, and stress_Score/ levels in the lifestyle dataset?
   
2. How do age groups differ in heart disease risk, and how do these risks patterns compare with age-specific coffee consumption patterns?

3.Can we build a predictive model that helps practitioners identify patients at higher risk of heart failure

## Data & Methodology
- Dataset: Health and lifestyle dataset containing caffeine intake, cardiovascular indicators, sleep, stress, and age variables
- Methods:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Correlation analysis
  - Data visualization
  - Predictive modeling (Logistic Regression and KNN)
- Tools:
  - Python
  - Power BI
  - SQL
  - Excel

## Key Findings
- Caffeine intake showed **no clinically meaningful relationship** with resting heart rate.
- No relationship was observed between caffeine intake and BMI.
- Sleep quality demonstrated the **strongest negative association** with caffeine intake.
- High-stress individuals tended to consume more caffeine, suggesting a potential feedback cycle.
- Cardiovascular risk increased with age, independent of coffee consumption.
- Logistic Regression outperformed KNN and provided interpretable results suitable for clinical contexts.

## Clinical Value
- Supports evidence-based patient counseling
- Helps clinicians identify caffeine-sensitive individuals
- Reinforces that moderate coffee intake is generally safe for most adults
- Highlights sleep quality as a key intervention area
