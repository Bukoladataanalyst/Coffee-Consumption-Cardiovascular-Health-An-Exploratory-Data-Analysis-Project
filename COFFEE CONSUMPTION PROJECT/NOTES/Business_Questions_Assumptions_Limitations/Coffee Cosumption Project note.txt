# Project Notes

## Business Questions
1. To what extent does coffee consumption relate to cardiovascular indicators such as heart rate, BMI, sleep quality, and stress?
2. How do cardiovascular risk patterns vary by age group?
3. Can predictive modeling help identify individuals at higher risk of heart disease?

## Key Findings

### Heart Rate
- No clinically meaningful change in resting heart rate was observed as caffeine intake increased.
- The correlation between caffeine and heart rate was very weak, indicating minimal relationship.

### BMI
- No relationship was identified between caffeine intake and BMI.
- Weight patterns appear to be driven by broader lifestyle and metabolic factors rather than caffeine.

### Sleep Quality
- Sleep quality showed the strongest negative relationship with caffeine intake.
- Higher caffeine consumption was associated with reduced sleep duration and poorer sleep quality.

### Stress
- High-stress individuals consumed more caffeine on average.
- Findings suggest a possible cycle: stress → increased caffeine intake → poorer sleep.

### Age & Cardiovascular Risk
- Cardiovascular risk increased consistently with age.
- Coffee consumption declined among older adults, indicating no positive association between caffeine intake and heart disease risk.

### Predictive Modeling
- Logistic Regression achieved approximately 90% accuracy.
- The model was interpretable and suitable for healthcare decision support.
- KNN showed lower performance compared to Logistic Regression.

## Assumptions
- Coffee intake reflects overall caffeine consumption behavior.
- Self-reported lifestyle variables are reasonably accurate.
- The dataset reflects realistic population health trends.
- Observed relationships represent associations, not causation.

---

## Limitations
- Synthetic dataset limits generalizability to real-world populations.
- Other caffeine sources (tea, energy drinks) were not included.
- Cross-sectional data restricts causal inference.
- Medical history and medication use were unavailable.

## Clinical Relevance
- Supports patient education around moderate caffeine consumption.
- Identifies sleep-sensitive individuals who may benefit from caffeine reduction.
- Demonstrates the role of analytics in preventive healthcare strategies.
